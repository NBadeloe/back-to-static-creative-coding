        <p class="header-p">Paris Is Burning, the eternally influential documentary by Jennie Livingston that captured New York's '80s ballroom community and taught us about voguing, reading for filth, and throwing well-cast shade, is back. This time, the film, which Livingston has restored, will premiere for a new generation of queerlings. Beginning on June 14 for a two-week run, the iconic film will rollout with viewings in nationwide theaters, as well.</p>
          </section>
          <q>The most notable slang in contemporary queer culture comes from historically marginalized Black and Brown femmes, many of whom have been active in the underground ballroom scene for years.</q>
